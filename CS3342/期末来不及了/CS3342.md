## Software Engineering Introduction
- What is Software Engineering and SE as a profession?

	- Software Engineering is the **process** of solving customers' problems by developing software systems **within cost, time** and other constraints
	- SE as a profession requires:

		- A relevant education and continued learning
		- Have a holistic or system life-cycle focus
		- Work to industry standards
		- Have a balanced approach to technical task


- Importance of Software Engineering in the IT industry

	- The economies of nations are dependent on software
	- More and more systems are software controlled
	- SE represents a significant fraction in all developed countries

## Software Development Process

- What is software process?

	- A series of steps, road maps, that helps us create a timely and high-quality result.

- Software process model

	- An abstract representation of a process: it describes a process and guides the software development team 

- Four types of process model

	- Linear: Waterfall
	- Incremental: Incremental model, RAD(Rapid Application Development)
	- Evolutionary: Spiral, Prototyping Model
	- Other: CBSE

### Waterfall model (i.e. linear)

- Advantages:

	- Easy
	- Structured
- Disadvantages:

	- Sequential, does not reflect reality
	- Does not produce a prototype: Little feedback from the user, takes a long time to develop

- Definition: Follows a systematic, sequential approach to SW development that begins at the system level and progresses through analysis, design, code and testing.

### Incremental

- Requirements are well defined first, software is completed in small increments
- Combines the characteristics of waterfall and the iterative nature of the prototyping model

### Evolutionary Process Models
- Development and validation activities are carried out concurrently with rapid feedback
- Core requirements are well understood, but additional requirements are evolving and changing fast
- Advantages:

	- Iterative
	- Allows feedback
	- Provide steady, visible progess to customer
	
- Disadvantages:

	- Time estimation is difficult
	- Project completion date may be unknown

Prototype Model:
- A quick design, developed very quickly, but disadvantages include performance, reliability

Spiral Model:
- Iterative (like prototype) and controlled (waterfall)

- Advantages:

	- Can be combined with other models
	- Provides early warning of problems

- Disadvantages:

	- More complex
	- Requires more management

Concurrent Model:
- Explicitly use the **divide and conquer** principle

### CBSE
- Reuse is a development objective, CBSE emphases on composing solutions from prepackaged software components or classes
- CBSE components are independent so that they do not interfere with one another
- Components implementations are hidden
- Reducing development efforts / costs


## Object Oriented Programming

Advantages of OO Paradigm
- Easier to maintain
- Objects are potentially reusable components

### Inheritance
Advantages:
	- Abstraction mechanism to classify entities
	- Supports reuse
	- provides a mechanism to extend or refine a class

### Polymorphism
- An OO feature that allows subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclass (method overriding)


## Roles of Variables

- Constant / Fixed value

	- Write once and read many
	- A variable initialized without any calculation and whose value does not change thereafter

- Stepper (incrementor, i++)

	- A variable stepping through values that can be predicted


- Most-Recent Holder (latest input value)

	- Most recent member of a group, or simply latest input value

- Gatherer (accumulator)

	- Purpose: Accumulates values seen so far
	- A variable accumulating the effect of individual values in going through a succession of values

- Transformation

	- Purpose: Compute value in new unit
	- A variable that always gets its new value from the same calculation

- One-way Flag (Boolean, True/False)

- Temporary (tmp value variable)
	- e.g. temp in swap(a, b)

- Organizer (Data Container, Array, List)





## Class Association
- Composition (Black Diamond)

	- A has B
	- Must / Compulsory

- Aggregation (white Diamond)

	- A has B
	- Optional

- Association (Just a line)

	- A uses B

### Design Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

	- Object classes should have a single responsibility (single purpose)
	- If you have a class that does two things, you should split it
	- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

	- open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

	- Derived subclasses (sub-types) must be completely substitutable for their parent class (base type)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

	- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
	- Avoid classes with too many responsibilities
	- Divide a large interface into a set of smaller interfaces, but make sure that each interface should be self-contained
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

	- A super class in an inheritance hierarchy should not know any information about its subclasses
	- Classes with detailed implementations must depend upon their abstractions, but not vice versa
	- DIP using abstract/virtual classes is a way to achieve OCP

	- High level modules should not depend on low level ones (button and lamp)
	- Use interface/abstract for better extension
- Law of Demeter (LoD)

	- Each unit should only have limited knowledge about other units: only about units "closely" related to the current unit.

### Design Patterns
- State Pattern

	- Ability to change to another state with ease
	- According to different classifications at run-time
- Strategy Pattern

	- Similar to State Pattern, but with only 1 function
- Singleton Pattern

	- Need only one instance for a class, prevents creating more than one object
- Factory Pattern

	- Defines an interface for creating object
	- Leaves the "choice" of its type to the subclasses
	- creation of object at run-time
- Facade Pattern

	- Provide a simplified interface to the other code
	- Reduce dependencies of outside code
- Observer Pattern

	- The current state/change of the objects need to be informed
	- A subject has to be observed by one or more objects
- Command Pattern

	- Encapsulate commands(method calls) in objects
	- Allows saving requests in a queue for reference (log)

## Professional Ethics

- four virtual

	- Prudence
	- Temperance
	- Fortitude
	- Justice

- five P's

	- Purpose
	- Pride
	- Patience
	- Persistence
	- **Perspective** is the inner guidance gained from the other P's that allows us to see the issue more clearly


### Eight code of Ethics
- Public interest
- Client and employer: best interest
- Product: highest standards
- Judgement: integrity and independence
- Management: ethical (e.g. equal opportunity and management)
- Profession
- Colleagues: be fair and supportive
- Self: lifelong learning

Why is code of ethics important to software engineers
- Powerful instruments for professionalism and safeguards
- Educate and inspire profession members
- Inform the public about the responsibilities
- Instruct the engineers about the standards of the society
- offer practical advise about issues that matter to professionals
