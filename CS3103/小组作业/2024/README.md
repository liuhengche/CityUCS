# IMPORTANT
The project has two parts, namely **priority scheduling** and **named pipe**. You are welcome to reference **priority scheduling** as my teammates finished them, but I did not finish my part for projectB. If you read the code carefully, you'll find that **named pipe** is not achieved, it's simply a string storing the message, no file was created. But TAs are very generous with the scores. I am too rubbish TwT
