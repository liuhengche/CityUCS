## Tree
- Deletion for binary tree:

	- delete a leaf node: set the parent node's corresponding child pointer to NULL
	- delete a node that has 1 subtree: set the parent's child pointer to root of unwanted node's subtree (left or right)
	- delete a node that has 2 subtrees: replace it with the in-order sequence node (the leftmost of the right subtree)

- DeleteMax() for max heap:

	- switch the root node(maximum) with the last decedent, and then do the updates for the heap
